Modifications:
First i want us to ignore what the current result picked up under missing which are not vital for me such as images and Category, hence even if workflow got it and manual didnt i dont want to see it under missing!Just other vital info that are detected under the manual that are not in workflow should go under missing. then secondly, why do i have something like:
  
.....etc
- Wattage
  Manual: 9.4w
  Workflow: Not found
.....etc

under ❌ Missing

while we actually have this:
etc... 
- Power Consumption: 9.4W
...etc

under ✅ Matched!

which is actually not supposed right, seems hallucinated! Can we fix that too?
